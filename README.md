# NewsOnAir
Listen to news from All India Radio using this Java Application  

This application uses a slightly modified version of the python web crawler <a href = "https://github.com/buckyroberts/Spider">Spider</a> to crawl the homepage of <a href= "http://www.newsonair.com/">News On Air</a> to gather links of all .mp3 files. The application then filters through the links to get the relevant working url's for the player. This is crucial because the format of links keeps on changing. Currently, it provides options for English News only. Addition of other languages in the coming commits.
